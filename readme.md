# Pushup Challenge

Welcome to the Pushup Challenge! This is a progressive web application that helps you hit a goal of doing one more pushup than the day before.

## Functionality

Using the Pushup Challenge is simple. All you have to do is open the application and it will tell you how many pushups you have left to do for the day. Every day, the application will automatically increase the number of pushups by one.

So, if you do one pushup today, tomorrow you'll have two pushups to do. And if you do two pushups today, tomorrow you'll have three pushups to do.

### Benefits

By taking on the Pushup Challenge, you will be able to increase your strength and endurance. It's also a great way to stay motivated and keep yourself accountable. Plus, it's fun! Who doesn't love a good challenge?
